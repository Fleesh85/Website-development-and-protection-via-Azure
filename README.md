<h2>Description</h2>

I used Microsoft Azure to build and host my own “cyber-blog” web application. I secured it with a SSL certificate, and applied Azure’s security features to protect it. 


<b>Our requirements included:</b>

- Hosting the web application using Azure’s Cloud Services
- Using Azure’s App Service resource to create the web application
- Choosing a domain with “godaddy or Azure” (choose what you selected)
- Deploying a Docker container which had a framework for a blog webpage
- SSHing  into the container to customize the webpage
- Creating a Self-signed certificate with OpenSSL 
- Storing the certificate in Azure’s Key vault
- Binding the certificate to the website (If you didn't select the free option)
- After determining the security issues with a self-signed certificate, creating and bound a managed CA approved certificate to the web application
- Deploying Azure’s Front Door, and configuring a WAF rule to restrict traffic from certain countries
- Analyzing the Azure’s Security Center recommendations and applying the recommend fix
 
<b>This project covered a wide range of topics including:</b> 

- Systems administration
- Networking
- Network security
- Cryptography
